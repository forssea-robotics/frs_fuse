/**
 * @brief A motion model base class that provides an internal callback queue and executor.
 *
 * A model model plugin is responsible for generating constraints that link together timestamps
 * introduced by other sensors in the system. The MujocoMotionModel class is designed similar to a
 * nodelet, attempting to be as generic and easy to use as a standard ROS node.
 *
 * There are a few notable differences between the MujocoMotionModel class and a standard ROS
 * node. First and most obvious, the MujocoMotionModel class is designed as a plugin, with all of
 * the stipulations and requirements that come with all ROS plugins (must be derived from a known
 * base class, will be default constructed). Second, the MujocoMotionModel class provides an internal
 * node that is hooked to a local callback queue and local executor on init. This makes
 * it act like a full ROS node -- subscriptions trigger message callbacks, callbacks will fire
 * sequentially, etc. However, authors of derived classes should be aware of this fact and avoid
 * creating additional sub-nodes, or at least take care when creating new sub-nodes and
 * additional callback queues. Finally, the interaction of motion model nodes is best compared to
 * a service call -- an external actor will provide a set of timestamps and wait for the motion
 * model to respond with the required set of constraints to link the timestamps together (along
 * with any previously existing timestamps). In lieu of a ROS service callback function, the
 * MujocoMotionModel class requires the applyCallback() function to be implemented. This callback
 * will be executed from the same callback queue as any other subscriptions or service callbacks.
 *
 * Derived classes:
 * - _probably_ need to implement the onInit() method. This method is used to configure the motion
 *    model for operation. This includes things like accessing the parameter server and subscribing
 *    to sensor topics.
 * - _must_ implement the applyCallback() method. This is the communication mechanism between the
 *    parent/optimizer and the derived motion model. This is how the optimizer tells the motion
 *    model what timestamps have been added, and how the motion model sends motion model constraints
 *    to the optimizer.
 * - may _optionally_ implement the onGraphUpdate() method. This should only be done if the derived
 *   motion model needs access to the latest values of the state variables. In many cases, motion
 *   models will simply not need that information. If the motion model does need access the to
 *   graph, the most common implementation will simply be to move the provided pointer into a class
 *   member variable, for use in other callbacks.
